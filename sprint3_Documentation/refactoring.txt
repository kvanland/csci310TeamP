What you refactored
Why

1. 4/20 Vanland and Zolintakis
What you refactored: Changed class of buttons in index.html and style.css from purpleButton to defaultButton
Why: purpleButton was based off of the project 1 UI so it no longer applied. This change improved readability

2.4/21 Vanland and Zolintakis
What you refactored: Moved scripts in index.html file to head tag.
Why:This is the most common practice

3. 4/23/17
What you refactored: Created the article list and conference list on a common canvas. Also created a createTable function to consolidate functionality
Why: Makes the code more readable and easier to edit

4. 4/23/17 Zolintakis and Vanland
What you refactored: In javascript file changed hideArticleList() to clearView()
Why: clearView calls hideArticleList and has extra functionality that the system needs to execute

5. 4/25/17 Schule and Fong
What you refactored: Implemented exception handling in PDFParser.php
Why: Better practice since code may sometimes fail in situations we have no control over (file downloaded from remote server)
