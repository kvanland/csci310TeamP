# Sprint 3 Documentation Guide

Before each pair programming session
- Take a picture of the two developers who will be working together
- Update whatever tasks you plan to accomplish on the task chart to 'in progress'

During each pair programming session
- Actively look for code to refactor and once you refactor document it in the refactoring directory
- Actively look for bugs in the code, create tests for each bug found in the code and document those tests
- Actively update the task chart once you finish or take on a task

After each pair programming session
- Run the entire test suite on the system and document the output in the pair programming folder for the current session
- Double check that all above guidelines have been followed and then commit and push the code.
