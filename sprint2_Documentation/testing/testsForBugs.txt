1.	Bug found

	Test description/location

2.  On 4/6 pair programming session: In “WordCloud.php” When parsing the json returned by the crossref api that searches the ACM library based on a keyword or author, sometimes the author key had “name”keys inside it instead of the “given” key and it would crash the php file.

	We created “testGetArticleListACMNameInAuthorBug()” in “WordCloudTest.php” that does a search that returns “name” as one of its keys

3. On 4/9 Zolintakis and Vinland Session: Word Class was not incrementing individual article occurrences correctly. It would would reset to one instead of incrementing.

	We created “testAddNotFirstArticle” in “WordTest.php” to make sure an article’s occurrences increments properly
