Guide to documentation 

For Developers:
	For each pair programming session before you begin
	1. Take a picture of the team members who are pair programming
	2. Upload the picture to the pairProgramming directory
	3. Add the date and name of team members for this session to the log.txt file in pairProgramming directory

	During each pair programming session 
	1. Remember to add tests for ANY bug found while working
	2. Any tests added must be updated within the file testsForBugs.txt testing directory
	3. Remember to update the taskChart as needed
	4. Remember to refactor at least one part of the code during each session
	5. Any refactoring should be documented in the log.txt file in the refactorying directory

	After each pair programming session
	1. Double check that all previous guidelines have been followed
	2. Run all testing acceptance/unit and add the output of those tests to a file within the testing directory with the naming convention testingOutput#.txt where # would be replaced by an increasing number for each file
	3. Commit the changes made during this session

For Scrums:
	While answering the 3 questions for each scrum document the responses of everyone and log those into the google document after the stand up is completed. Also take a picture of the standup and upload that picture to the scrumMeetings directory.
