What was refactored:
Refactored WordCloud.php to use Word class instead of simply storing strings of words
Why it was refactored: 
Now we have a list of articles associated with a word from the moment we parse an article. This saves us from repeating this work later

What was refactored:
Added constants to constant file, Constant.php
Why?
It is good practice to store constants in the constant file. This way, we can have all our constants in a central location for easy modification
