4/5/17 Pair Programming team: Noah, Kyle
What was refactored:
Refactored WordCloud.php to use Word class instead of simply storing strings of words
Why it was refactored: 
Now we have a list of articles associated with a word from the moment we parse an article. This saves us from repeating this work later

4/6/17 Pair Programming team: Noah, Kyle
What was refactored:
Added constants to constant file, Constant.php
Why?
It is good practice to store constants in the constant file. This way, we can have all our constants in a central location for easy modification

What was refactored:
Changed loop to check if counter is less than 250 and the array its parsing instead of checking if the counter is equal to the array size in the loop.
Why?
Better readability and slightly more efficient

4/7/17 Pair programming team: Zolintakis, Vanland
What was refactored:
1. The articleList array in WordCloud.php was changed from a regular array to associative array
2. We also changed the documentToWordCloud method in WordCloud.php to get rid of repeated line of code
Why?
1. Necessary for maximizing efficiency in getListOfArticles method
2. Increase readability

4/9/17 Pair Programming Team: Noah, Alec
What was refactored:
Refactored front-end to utilize global variables at all times
Why?
It is good practice to use global variables, especially if we have already declared them. It enhances readability and makes it easier to make changes to the code.

4/9/17 Pair Programming: Zolintakis and Vanland
What was refactored?
Added article id and database id into the json for each article in the article list being sent to frontend 
Why?
It makes future features easier to implement

4/11/17 Pair Programming: Zolintakis and Vanland
What was refactored?
Changed the api call from GetArticleList to GetWordArticleList and the method in WordCloud.php from getListOfArticles to GetWordListOfArticles
Why?
These names make more sense because the system gets an article list based off a word or a conference

4/12/17 Pair Programming: Fong an Bergman
What was refactored?
The control flow of the front-end search and article apis were refactored.
Why?
Before we were not waiting fully for requests to finish. This could potentially cause bugs
