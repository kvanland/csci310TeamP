4/5/17 Pair Programming team: Noah, Kyle
What was refactored:
Refactored WordCloud.php to use Word class instead of simply storing strings of words
Why it was refactored: 
Now we have a list of articles associated with a word from the moment we parse an article. This saves us from repeating this work later
